There are different ways of knowing something.

I encountered this idea in [[Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete]] and [[wiki/commonplace/Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance|Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance]]. 

There is a threat in acknowledging this. Motivated actors can claim that all ways of knowing something are valid, which can open up to door to accepting dubious epistemological practices as well.
