# Sexual Drive

![Film Poster](sexual-drive.webp)

Three short stories about people rediscovering their sexual drive. This is a pretty tame, SFW movie about cravings and desire. If anything the movie relies on the imagery of food to convey sexuality. Its funny in part. I think it actually helps going in knowing that this is a funny movie rather than a sexy movie. My favourite thing about the movie was the recurring character of Kurita. A loony man dressed in a suit, playing what I could only imagine to be some kind of a sex fairy who visits you and brings back your sexual drive.
