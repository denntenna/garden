# Overview
This essay speaks to some of my intuition that what is puzzling about the information eco system is not that people believe in fake news but why do people believe in true things. The default state of the world is to be ignorant and irrational. Its more important to study why they believe what they believe. How is their belief in things beyond their immediate material and social environment mediated through norms and institutions.

# Commonplace
Joseph Health points out in Cooperation and Social Justice, the ability to appreciate "explanatory inversions" is one of the things that most sharply distinguishes a scientifically informed worldview from a commonsense one

The real epistemic challenge for the twenty-first century is not to combat misinformation, except insofar as doing this helps us achieve a deeper more fundamental goal; maintaining and improving our best epistemic norms and institutions, and winning trust in, and conformity to, them.

[[Public Opinion]]

Social Epistemology - the study of phenomena such as knowledge, belief and understanding in society - similarly needs an explanatory inversion.

We believe certain things to be true because of their social functions.
