Paul Freyerband, Against Method: The outline of an anarchic theory of knowledge. Unversity of Minnesota Press. 1975

Here the word anarchy is about liberation from state control. 

... And as the accepting and rejecting fo ideologies should be left to the individual it follows that the separation of state and church must be supplemented by the separation of state and science.

The work is notable in the history and philosophy of science partially due to its detailed case study of [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo")'s hypothesis that the [earth rotates on its axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") and has since become a staple reading in introduction to philosophy of science courses at undergraduate and graduate levels
