Hegel - 1770-1831
	The phenomenology of mind
	the science of logic
	the philosophy of right
	the philosophy of history

Peter Singer
	introduction to hegel in simple english

because hegel is so abstract but history is concrete, his book the philosophy of history is a good way to get into hegel

Kant - 
	human beings are split between reasoning elements and their root desires
Hegel disagreed
	greek was more harmonious. their desires were in harmony in reason
	harmony could be restore

as societies change, concepts change
there was 

the dialectical process/change :
the reason
	thesis -> anti-thesis -> synthesis (harmonious state) -> rinse/repeat
understanding the dialectical process is a way to understand history
every complex system has conflicting forces in it, which means its unstable and hence they must evolve into a new system where the previous forces are resolved/assuaged. but of course the new system has other conflicts and so the cycle repeats.

the dialectical process has a direction
	goal : greater development of mind towards freedom

he's writing about "geist"
	mind, 
	zeitgeist - spirit

total reality is more than matter ?
	reality is more than matter

alienation
	something that is part of us seems alien
	unhappy soul - alienated form or religion
mind is everything

hegel's philosophy is achievement of 

freedom and self-knowledge

rationally ordered society
	its not the society of pure reason 
		what the french revolutionaries wanted
			hegel saw that as bad
				that was abstract reason take to extreme
	find the rational in the real and take them to fullfilment

can you do what you prefer vs why do you prefer what you prefer?
	are they rational preferences?
freedom includes fulfilling yourself as a rational individual

form and content is together

central concept : 
	understanding reality is not about grasping a given state of affairs, its understaning a process of perpetual change

if one asks what is that is changing, it is "geist"
					why is it chagning, because its in a state of alienation
					what is the pattern of change, its the dialectical process
					where is the change headed, organic society, absolute knowledge 

fertility of his ideas in various fields
	theology, economics, law etc

followers split - left hegelians and right hegelians

right hegelians
	somethign like the prussian state (1830) was the organic state
left hegelians
	the basic thrust of his philosophy is much more radical
		reason vs desire
		morality vs self interest
	marx was part of it

what marx coopted
	-> historical process
	-> dialectical change
	-> its going towards a goal
	-> a conflict free society
	-> until we reach there, we are in alienation

hegel thought of these thigns in the context of "geist" or mind but marx applied them to "materials"
	he was a materialist

marx hated subordination, loved freedom
	hated servility the most

marx and hegel's idea did get distorted
