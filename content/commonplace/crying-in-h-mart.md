# Crying in H Mart

![Book Cover](crying-in-h-mart.png)

A memoir.
A daughter reflects on her life after her mother succumbs to Cancer.

I've been reading such books to serve as a guide on dealing with my current situation.

The novel is honest. It does not sugar coat cancer. We see the author be thrown into caretaking her mother and are given a front seat to viewing all her thoughts - The selfish, ugly and scared.

The mother is the anchor for this family and its clear that there's no family without her. We see things unravel. We see a lost daugher come off after her mother dies. She sheds off the baggage of her family (her father specifically) and finds new family in her husband and mother's sister.

The novel is also a great introduction to Korean cuisine. I took notes on some dishes but might need a second read just to fully grasp that :)
