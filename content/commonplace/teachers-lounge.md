# Teacher's Lounge

![Film Poster](teachers-lounge.jpg)

A German movie about a young idealistic teacher in a new middle school and how she resolves conflict and deals with an uncomfortable kleptomania situation at the school.
It is a little wishful and idealistic in that in a world where teachers just want to deal with situations suspending/rusticating someone, this teacher keeps saying things like "isolating this child would be a complete failure of the school" and she pays the price many times for her idealism and still perseveres. My cynicism aside, the movie does great justice to its theme!
