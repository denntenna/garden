The view that art, at its best, is a more important enterprise than the production of perfume or uphostery is not mere snobbery. Any enterprise that can provide knowledge will have an importance that entertainment and decoration cannot possess.

I have also included a bibliography, probably the most extensive yet compiled on the topic of art and knowledge.


first the author intends to prove that some art works have congitive value, then he wants to prove that all art works have cognitive value. then his eventual goal is to prove that only items with cognitive value count as artworks.

relational property vs intrinsic property.
arthood is a perspectival property. requires someone to percieve it.
a world without people who conceive of art is a world whithout art. michelangelo's david would possess the property of being made from marble even if no one thought it was. it would not possess the property of arthood if people did not employ the concept of art.

self notes : 
a good argument against popularity being the metric for something being art is that we actually don't know if the item is popular because it is entertaining, informative or cringey. Since this is not know, the views itself doesn't not give legitimacy to something's arthood.



artworlds could disagree about arthood of an item.
uses a twin earth analogy.

properties of art
functional, cognitive, aesthetic maybe? source of knowledge? novelty?
this leads me to the definition that my art should provide pleasure and knowledge.




it is often said that our interest in music, for example, is an interest in musical forms. Suppose of the nonce that music is valuable because its formal properties are fascinating.
