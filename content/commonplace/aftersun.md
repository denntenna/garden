# Aftersun

![Book Cover](aftersun.webp)

A very moving film about a woman reminiscing a vacation she took with her dad when she was a child. We see glimpses of some ominous event through the movie but its not very clear. When the film ends, it feels like the vacation she took as a child was probably the last time she saw her dad.

Now as an adult, as she is about to become a mother, she's relives the vacation hoping to find answers maybe for what went wrong.
