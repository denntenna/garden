# Overview
There are multiple ways to do computer programming. The analytical method is considered canonical and "right", which alienates people who work in a more bricoleur fashion. They either end up dis-identifying themselves as a programmer or pretend to work in the "right" way to fit in with the larger culture.

While the authors see an association between styles and gender in their study, their larger point is about accepting multiple ways of knowing and thinking.

# Notes
In this essay, authors use the computer as an instrument for observing different styles of scientific thought and develop categories for analysing them. Authors see differences across various dimensions between the student's strategy for organizing work and their manner of identifying with computational object. These are simplified into a soft approach vs a hard approach. 

Although our culture tends to equate soft with feminine and feminine with unscientific and undisciplined, the authors have made a conscious decision to use that term because soft is a good word for a flexible and non heirarchical style. Authors want to revaluate traditionally denigrated categories and explore ways in which soft is a valid approach for men as well as women, in science and arts.

Authors share some anecdotal cases from their study.
Lisa, 18, a first year Harvard Student does not want to use premade libraries in her code but wants to write her own building blocks. She thinks the libraries are opaque. If she writes the code herself, like she writes poems, she knows where every word/idea is at every stage.
After two months of programming, she abandons her own methods and simply accepts doing things "their way" and accepting the inevitable alienation from her work.
Another student who is a pianist, thinks of coding as playing piano and composes programs piecemeal by mastering smaller concepts one at a time.

Although the authors find a correlation that more women use soft approaches and more men use hard approaches, they say
> we believe that what is most important is not any statistical association between gender and programming styles, but what lies behind the styles and behind the resistance of our intellectual culture to recognise and facilitate them both. In our culture, those who use hard approaches don't simply share a style, they constitute an epistemological elite.

Discrimination exists at the epistemological level where a way of doing something is considered incorrect. People who want to approach the computer in a "non canonical" style are rarely given the opportunity to do so. When people are free to explore programming without preconceptions about the "right" way to do it, more women use soft approaches and more men hard approaches, although many men are alienated from the dominant engineering style and many women work creatively within it.

Two styles of working are studied in closer detail - bricolage and beyond bricolage.

## Bricolage
Bricolage is a concept take from Claud Levi-Strauss.
A bricoleur programmer is like a writer who does not start with an outline (like an analytic programmer might) but starts with an idea, associates it to another and find a connection with a third. In the end, an essay is grown through negotiation and association. Anne makes it clear that the difference between planners and bricoleurs is not in the quality of the product but in the process of creating it. 

## Beyond Bricolage
The objectivity in scientific method is highlighted as the only way to do science but STS scholarship shows that this is not the case. Many scientists do have a proximity to their materials, with some describing their practice of science as a conversation with the materials.

In their study, girls did better than boys in understanding gears and how they work. They saw things in terms of the relationships between them and used that to think through the problem.

# Fleeting Notes

The computer has a theoretical vocation: to bring the philosophical down to earth. 

Gilligan and Keller's work

The analytical way vs the native way
	top down planned approach
	vs a more playful approach where you reconfigure and move things around and look at it.

He had considered the structured approach but prefers his own style for aesthetic reasons.

While the structured programmer starts with a clear place defined in abstract terms, Alex lets the product emerge through a negotiation between himself and his material.


[[In a different voice]]
For women, the moral problem arises from conflicting responsibilities rather than from competing rights and requires for its resolution a mode of thinking that is contextual and narrative rather than formal and abstract.

girls did well with gears than boys
... tendency to see things in terms of relationships rather than properties.

ambivalent nature of computational objects
	on the border between the idea and a physical object, offers new possibilities.

In the computer they have found something in the domain of formal systems to which they can relate with informality.

In our culture, girls are taught negotiation, compromise, and the capacity for intimacy as social virtues, while models of male behaviour stress decisivenes, cool impartiality and the imposition of will. It would not be surprising if women felt more comfortable, more "themselves" with negotation and the compromise among elements of thought, and men preferred to make decisive plans and impose principles on a separate reality.

[[Francis Bacon]] used image of the male scientist putting the female nature "on the rack". And from its very foundation, objectivity in science has been engaged with the language of power, not only over nature, but over people and organizations.

... it is not surprising that many women feel uncomfortable both with science and with ways of thinking that have been associated with it

there is something more than #alienation of culture and style...

Robin says that people have "great flashes of abstract thought without any logical sequence before it. If you tried to do that with a computer, it would tell you it's a system error or illegal!"
makes me think of [[typed holes]] 

Epistemological Pluralism is a necessary condition for a more inclusive computer culture.
	What this means is that how people arrive at their solution or how they know to program should not be a single thing. allow variation and diversity here. This will make people feel welcome and enjoy their work.


the rarely challenged assumption that rules and logic are the highest form of reason.
I get the sense that where I was wrong is that the opposite of "rules and logic" was pseudo science or superstition. But as seen in the example of the bricolage scientists, one possible alternative to it is hands on experimentation. 
I wonder if this paper also specified an alternative.

Bricolage is a concept take from Claud Levi-Strauss.
Taken from the art world, bricolage is a combination of objects and artefacts from across social groups. Used in formation of hybrid identities.
particularly seen in youth
eg Hebdige(1979) punk subcultures influenced by styles of other social groups. Inspiration from goth and skinhead cultures

They respond to the dominant ethos of the computer culture by entering into an inauthentic relationship with the computer. #alienation 

a thinking environment that fits

towards the end it talks of OOPS as being more condusice to soft approach than imperative programming. I gues coz OOPS was new then. I wonder if the author stand by this now.,

... the new trends... all create an intellectual climate in the computational world that undermines the idea that formal methods are the only methods.


We believe that the three intellectual movements we have noted -- feminism, ethnography of science, and computation -- are elements
of a sea change that would not only recognize concrete thinking as important, but promote it to an object of science in its own right.

The role of feminist studies in the nascent computer culture is to promote the recognition of diversity in how we think about and appropriate formal systems and encourage the acceptance of our profound human connection with our tools

8 recognizes soft approach as an integral element of scientific practice.

## Later Reading

Levi-Strauss used the idea of bricolage to contrast the analytic methodology of Western science with what
he called a "science of the concrete" in primitive societies.11 The bricoleur scientist does not move abstractly
and hierarchically from axiom to theorem to corollary. Bricoleurs construct theories by arranging and
rearranging, by negotiating and renegotiating with a set of well-known materials

Levi-Strauss (1968). Levi-Strauss contrasted bricolage with Western science, ignoring the
significant aspects of bricolage present in the latter. Several recent writers have written in a way that
begins to redress this imbalance. See, for example, Feyerabend (1975), Hanson (1958), and
Wittgenstein (1953). In a less formal vein, see Feynman (1985)
