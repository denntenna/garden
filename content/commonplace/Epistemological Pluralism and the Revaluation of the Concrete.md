# Overview
Parts of it speak of the work of Gillian and Keller on native cultures and how they practice science in a non analytical manner. Made me think of [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]] 

# Commonplace
The computer has a theoretical vocation: to bring the philosophical down to earth.

In this chapter, we use the computer as an instrument for observing different styles of scientific thought and developing categories for analyzing them.

The "wrist slapping" narrows computer culture.
Talking about the right way to do something or doing it in service of one thing - becoming an enterprise software developer reduces the way to be.

People who want to approach the computer in a "non canonical" style are rarely given the opportunity to do so.

Discrimination in computer culture takes the form of discrimination against epistemological orientations.

We do not argue that valuable thinking is not soft; we explore ways in which soft is a valid approach for men as well as women, in science as well as the arts.

Classification and value of different ways of knowing

When people are free to explore programming without preconceptions about the "right" way to do it, more women use soft approaches and more men hard approaches, although many men are alienated from the dominant engineering style and many women work creatively within it.

Although the authors find a correlation that more women use soft approaches vs men using hard approaches, they say
... we beleive that what is most important is not any statistical association between gender and programming styles, but what lies behind the styles and behind the resistance of our intellectual culture to recognize and facilitate them both. In our culture, those who use hard approaches don't simply share a style, they constitute an epistemological elite.

Gilligan and Keller's work

The analytical way vs the native way
	top down planned approach
	vs a more playful approach where you reconfigure and move things around and look at it.

He had considered the structured approach but prefers his own style for aesthetic reasons.

While the structured programmer starts with a clear place defined in abstract terms, Alex lets the product emerge through a negotiation between himself and his material.

bricoleur programmers
In describing bricoleur programmers, we have made analogies to sculptors, cooks and painters. Bricoleurs are also like writers who don't use an outline but start with one idea, associate to another, and find a connection with a third. In the end, an essay "grown" through negotiation and association is not necessarily any less elegant or easy to read than one filled in from an outline, jst as the final program produced by a bricoleur can be elegant and organized as one wirtten with top-down approach

the difference between planners and the bricoleurs is not in quality of product, it is in the process of creating it.

Bricolage is a way to organize work. It is not a stage in a progression to a superior form.

[[In a different voice]]
For women, the moral problem arises from conflicting responsibilities rather than from competing rights and requires for its resolution a mode of thinking that is contextual and narrative rather than formal and abstract.

girls did well with gears than boys
... tendency to see things in terms of relationships rather than properties.

ambivalent nature of computational objects
	on the border between the idea and a physical object, offers new possibilities.

In the computer they have found something in the domain of formal systems to which they can relate with informality.

In our culture, girls are taught negotiation, compromise, and the capacity for intimacy as social virtues, while models of male behaviour stress decisivenes, cool impartiality and the imposition of will. It would not be surprising if women felt more comfortable, more "themselves" with negotation and the compromise among elements of thought, and men preferred to make decisive plans and impose principles on a separate reality.

[[Francis Bacon]] used image of the male scientist putting the female nature "on the rack". And from its very foundation, objectivity in science has been engaged with the language of power, not only over nature, but over people and organizations.

... it is not surprising that many women feel uncomfortable both with science and with ways of thinking that have been associated with it

there is something more than #alienation of culture and style...

Robin says that people have "great flashes of abstract thought without any logical sequence before it. If you tried to do that with a computer, it would tell you it's a system error or illegal!"
makes me think of [[typed holes]] 

Epistemological Pluralism is a necessary condition for a more inclusive computer culture.
	What this means is that how people arrive at their solution or how they know to program should not be a single thing. allow variation and diversity here. This will make people feel welcome and enjoy their work.


the rarely challenged assumption that rules and logic are the highest form of reason.
I get the sense that where I was wrong is that the opposite of "rules and logic" was pseudo science or superstition. But as seen in the example of the bricolage scientists, one possible alternative to it is hands on experimentation. 
I wonder if this paper also specified an alternative.

Bricolage is a concept take from Claud Levi-Strauss.
Taken from the art world, bricolage is a combination of objects and artefacts from across social groups. Used in formation of hybrid identities.
particularly seen in youth
eg Hebdige(1979) punk subcultures influenced by styles of other social groups. Inspiration from goth and skinhead cultures

They respond to the dominant ethos of the computer culture by entering into an inauthentic relationship with the computer. #alienation 

a thinking environment that fits

towards the end it talks of OOPS as being more condusice to soft approach than imperative programming. I gues coz OOPS was new then. I wonder if the author stand by this now.,

... the new trends... all create an intellectual climate in the computational world that undermines the idea that formal methods are the only methods.


We believe that the three intellectual movements we have noted -- feminism, ethnography of science, and computation -- are elements
of a sea change that would not only recognize concrete thinking as important, but promote it to an object of science in its own right.

The role of feminist studies in the nascent computer culture is to promote the recognition of diversity in how we think about and appropriate formal systems and encourage the acceptance of our profound human connection with our tools

## Later Reading

Levi-Strauss used the idea of bricolage to contrast the analytic methodology of Western science with what
he called a "science of the concrete" in primitive societies.11 The bricoleur scientist does not move abstractly
and hierarchically from axiom to theorem to corollary. Bricoleurs construct theories by arranging and
rearranging, by negotiating and renegotiating with a set of well-known materials

Levi-Strauss (1968). Levi-Strauss contrasted bricolage with Western science, ignoring the
significant aspects of bricolage present in the latter. Several recent writers have written in a way that
begins to redress this imbalance. See, for example, Feyerabend (1975), Hanson (1958), and
Wittgenstein (1953). In a less formal vein, see Feynman (1985)
