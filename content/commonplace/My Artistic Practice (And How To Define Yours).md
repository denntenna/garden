# Fleeting Notes
Artistic practice extends beyond the physical activities of making artistic products and can include influences, ideas, materials as well as tools and skills.

Try answering the following questions to define your artistic practice
- What Inspires me to create?
- What do I usually do to get started on a piece or project?
- How do I come up with original ideas? Does it come from current events, personal thoughts or experiences?
- What is my medium of choice? Am I exploring other types?
- How would I describe the work I create?
- How is it evolving?
