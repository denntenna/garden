# Tenet

![Film Poster](tenet.jpeg)

I watch Christopher Nolan movies for the following :

1. The concept/puzzle
2. The story and the drama
3. Great background score

When he manages to combine atleast 2 of them, I call it "paisa-wasool" - The Dark Knight (2,3) or The Prestige (1,2). When he is succesfully able to combine all three, it becomes my most favourite Nolan movie - Interstellar.

Tenet is heavy on the Puzzle but lacks on the other two. I will be watching it again because I don't think you can crack all the pieces of the puzzle in one sitting. Its a movie that needs to be watched many times and going over a lot of reddit fan analysis to fully grasp.
