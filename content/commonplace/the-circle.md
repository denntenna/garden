# The Circle

![Film Poster](./covers/circle.webp)

Made in 2000. The story showcases the lives of multiple Iranian women living under an oppressive regime. The story structure involves interconnected stories, one leading into the other and the next one taking over. The one thing that stayed with me was, when I got heavily invested in one character's story, and saw her enter into helpless situations from which no relief is visible, the film moves on to the next character. It left me wondering and imagining what must have happened to that character.
