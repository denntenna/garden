# Carrie

![Book Cover](carrie.jpeg)

A teenage girl with telekinesis gets back at her bullies.

My first Stephen King book. I decided to go through some of Stephen King's work and had a hard time picking
the first one to start with. I was worried I'll judge the book against the screen adaptations.
I love Stanley Kubrick's Shining a lot, so decided against picking that up. I find the it clown annoying in the trailer that I saw. So I didnt want that to cloud my judgement. Stumbled upon Carrie and picked it up for two reasons

1. It was King's first novel
2. I knew nothing about the plot.

Unfortunately within the first 50 pages or so I realized that the subplot of eleven from Stranger Things in Season 4 was a homage to Carrie. So this turned out to not be a truly novel reading experience. That aside I cruised through the novel in a day. Enjoyed King's fast paced writing. This being a short novel helped.
