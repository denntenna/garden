# Pickpocket

![Film Poster](pickpocket.webp)

Made in 1997. Lacking any historical context, I most certainly must have missed out a lot of socio-political references in the movie. What I undertood was that this was a story of China undergoing changes. The protagonist is a pickpocket, perhaps too reluctant or carefree to change his ways who get caught in the crossfire of changing times.
