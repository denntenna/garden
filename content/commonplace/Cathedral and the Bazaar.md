# Fleeting Notes

What is culture in the context of the hacker culture?
slangs and jargons? in jokes?
How do you build culture at a place like Tattle.
what is the culture of Tattle?

Necessary preconditions for the Bazaar-style development
your nascent developer community needs to have something runnable and testable to play with
present a *plausible promise* to your community. doesnt have to work particularly well.
it must do two things
1. run
2. convince potential developers that it can be evolved into something really neat

both linux and fetchmail used design principles from predecessors. not genious as such.

internal market in reputation serves as checks and balances to only announce projects you can pull through

bazaar model works if you have some skills at charming people

to solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you

while coding remains an essentially solitary activity, the really great hacks come from harnessing the attentin and the brainpower of entire communities.

in a foss project the maintainers work is of coordination

linux also has great documentation?
man! what is all this talk about documentation? is it the secret weapon?

foss is not a moral choice. its better for the software

### Lock and Land Title
Lockean property customs arise only when the expected returns from the resource exceeds the expected cost of defending it.

pg 78
noosphere and ergosphere

### The hacker milieu as Gift Culture
Pg 79
Exchange Cultures and Gift Cultures
in abundant cultures, people achieve reputation by gifting.

pg 82
There is more than one way to run a gift culture.
History and values matter.
This could be a starting off point for how and why tattle does foss.

pg 87
Unconscious knowledge of a culture is at odds with its conscious ideology

### How fine a gift
patterns with how hacker culture values contribution and returns peer esteem for them.

pg 94
because of reputation risks, foss is not 1.0 till very late.

work that extends the noospeher is better than work that duplicates an existing piece of functional territory
ie. original work is better than mere duplication of the functions of an existing software.

3. works included in bigger distros
4. utilization 
5. continued devotion to hard, boring work like debugging or writing documentations

## Cathedral and the Bazaar

What is the cathedral model and the bazaar model?

Lessons learnt by eric in the bazaar

1 Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch

2 Reuse existing work

3 Be ready to start over atleast once

4 if you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.

5 When you lose interest in a program, your last duty is to hand it off to a competent successor.

6 Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.

> Linus's cleverest and most consequential hack was not the construction of the Linux Kernel itself, but rather his invention of the Linux Development model.

Emacs, MATLAB have a hybrid model where the innovations take part in the bazaar part whereas the core is built in the cathedral style.

 
7 Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.

8 Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem with be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.

Linus - Somone finds the problem, somebody else understands it... finding it is the bigger challenge.

bazaar style greatly accelerates debugging and code evaluation

> Open Source development breaks this bind, making it far easier for tester and developer to develop a shared representation grounded in the actual source code and to communicate effectively about it.

project core - 1 to 3 developers
project halo - beta testers and available contributors - in the hundreds

I don't think the adhoc numbered lessons in the chapter do any service to the premise of the chapter.

9 Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.

10 If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource

Engaging with users aggressively by communicating with them and releasing things very often.

11 The next best thing to having a good idea is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.

12 Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong

Even at a higher level of design, it can be very valuable to have lots of co-developers random-walking through the design space near your product. 


### Necessary Preconditions for the Bazaar Style
Your nascent developer community needs to have something runnable and testable to play with.

To make a bazaar model work, it helps enormously if you have atleast a little skill at charming people.

### The social context of open source software
The developer who uses only his or her brain in a closed project is going to fall behind the developer who knows how to create an open, evolutionary context in which feedback exploring the design space, code contributions, bug spotting and other improvements come from others


the utility function that the linux hackers are maximising is not economic but the intangible of their ego satisfaction and reputation among other hackers.

Linux hackers generate so much documentation!
