# The God of Small Things

![Book Cover](tgosmt.jpg)

Two twins Rahel and Estha separated at a young age reunite after a gap of 25 years or so. We are hinted towards a tragic event from the past that led to their separation. The novel then walks us through how the history of Kerala, Syrian Christians, Communist movement and Casteism intertwined in small ways to contribute to their tragedy.

Through her description of various prejudices, "love laws" and boundaries, Roy constructs a complete picture of the complex social fabric of Kerala.

## Quotes :

> Kathakali discovered long ago that the secret of the Great stories is that they have no secrets. The great Stories are the ones you have heard and what to hear again.

## Unorganized Notes :

- Upper caste/class obsession with smell in the movie parasite and this novel too.
- the phrase rice-christians in in this novel. how old is it? Came across this [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Christian) that dates it as far back as to 16891
